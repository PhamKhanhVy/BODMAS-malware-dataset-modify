# BODMAS MALWARE Dataset_MODIFY
 Extract the feature vectors
1. BODMAS is short for Blue Hexagon Open Dataset for Malware AnalysiS. We collaborate with Blue Hexagon to release a dataset containing timestamped malware samples and well-curated family information for research purposes. The BODMAS dataset contains 57,293 malware samples and 77,142 benign samples collected from August 2019 to September 2020, with carefully curated family information (581 families).

2. Extract the feature vectors using the LIEF project (version 0.9.0), the same as the Ember dataset (details can be found here). Each sample is represented as a 2381 feature vector.

* Further details can be found in our paper “BODMAS: An Open Dataset for Learning based Temporal Analysis of PE Malware” [PDF], Deep Learing and Security Workshop 2021 (co-located with IEEE Security and Privacy 2021).

* If you end up building on this dataset as part of a project or publication, please include a reference to our paper:

1. Download the zip file `BODMAS_disarmed_malware_binaries.zip`, unzip.

2. Get the absolute paths of all the binaries inside the unzipped directories, save as a file called `arm.txt`, each line represents the path to a binary.

3. Create a folder under the same directory called `armed`, used to save restored binaries.

4. Run the following script (tested on Python 3 with [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) and [pefile](https://pypi.org/project/pefile/) library):
   `nohup python PE_modifier.py --filelist arm.txt --altered_folder armed --arm > restore.log &`

5. Check the `armed` folder for original executable malware binaries.
